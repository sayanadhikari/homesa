	abstract = {The potential and density wake behind a finite-sized object in a magnetized collisionless plasma flow is studied with self-consistent numerical simulations. With increasing magnetization of the plasma, the standard picture of ion focusing in the wake for plasmas with large electron to ion temperature ratios becomes invalid. A strong magnetic field parallel to the flow direction leads to a chain of ion depletions in the wake and enhanced ion density at their envelopes. This is due to a novel mechanism of a dynamic ion shadow, which is not the geometrical shadow of the finite-sized object. It corresponds to a change in topology of the wake potential. Complex ion trajectories resulting from electrostatic collisions with the object can lead to significant variations in electrical charging of other objects in the wake.},

@article{friedemann_2019,
	abstract = {Multiphase flow simulations were run in OpenFOAM utilizing InterFoam, a volume of fluid type solver. A concentric annulus geometry was constructed and periodic boundary conditions were applied to alleviate the requirement for a longer domain. The simulations were run in 3, 5 and 7 m long domains with the annulus dimensioned such that the outer and inner cylinder diameter were 0.1 and 0.05 m respectively. The 4 individual mesh designs were constructed such that the coarsest mesh consists of 102k cells/m while the finest mesh was generated with 400k cells/m. Each mesh was significantly refined within 0.005 m of both the inner and outer cylinder wall. The simulation data was compared with experimental pressure and holdup data collected at Institute for Energy Technology in Norway. The 3 and 7 m domains reproduced slug frequencies to within 9% of the experiment results of 1.43 Hz for all mesh densities. Comparatively, the 5 m domain has larger errors with respect to slugging frequency (22--27%). The 5 m case performs poorly, probably due to an artificial restraint introduced by the limitation of available liquid which is set as αoil=0.53 for all cases. The αoil restriction combined with the domain length determines the amount of liquid in the system. This interaction of factors means that the domain length is an important parameter when preparing the simulation. The pressure data display a stronger dependence on the mesh quality in comparison to the slug frequency analysis. The 3 m domain with a 400k cells/m mesh resulted in a maximum and minimum pressure gradient of 1783.5 and 803.9 Pa/m, compared to the experiment values of 1785 and 822 Pa/m, which are within 3% of the expected results.},

@article{Bergersen2018,
	abstract = {abstract The utility of flow simulations relies on the robustness of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers and reproducibility of results. The aim of this study was to validate the Oasis CFD solver against in vitro experimental measurements of jet breakdown location from the FDA nozzle benchmark at Reynolds number 3500, which is in the particularly challenging transitional regime. Simulations were performed on meshes consisting of 5, 10, 17, and 28 million (M) tetrahedra, with Δt  =  10−5 seconds. The 5M and 10M simulation jets broke down in reasonable agreement with the experiments. However, the 17M and 28M simulation jets broke down further downstream. But which of our simulations are ``correct''? From a theoretical point of view, they are all wrong because the jet should not break down in the absence of disturbances. The geometry is axisymmetric with no geometrical features that can generate angular velocities. A stable flow was supported by linear stability analysis. From a physical point of view, a finite amount of ``noise'' will always be present in experiments, which lowers transition point. To replicate noise numerically, we prescribed minor random angular velocities (approximately 0.31\%), much smaller than the reported flow asymmetry (approximately 3\%) and model accuracy (approximately 1\%), at the inlet of the 17M simulation, which shifted the jet breakdown location closer to the measurements. Hence, the high-resolution simulations and ``noise'' experiment can potentially explain discrepancies in transition between sometimes ``sterile'' CFD and inherently noisy ``ground truth'' experiments. Thus, we have shown that numerical simulations can agree with experiments, but for the wrong reasons.},

@article{Mortensen2016,
	abstract = {abstract Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the Navier Stokes equations is an invaluable research tool in fluid dynamics. Still, there are few publicly available research codes and, due to the heavy number crunching implied, available codes are usually written in low-level languages such as C/C++ or Fortran. In this paper we describe a pure scientific Python pseudo-spectral \{DNS\} code that nearly matches the performance of C++ for thousands of processors and billions of unknowns. We also describe a version optimized through Cython, that is found to match the speed of C++. The solvers are written from scratch in Python, both the mesh, the \{MPI\} domain decomposition, and the temporal integrators. The solvers have been verified and benchmarked on the Shaheen supercomputer at the \{KAUST\} supercomputing laboratory, and we are able to show very good scaling up to several thousand cores. A very important part of the implementation is the mesh decomposition (we implement both slab and pencil decompositions) and 3D parallel Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). The mesh decomposition and \{FFT\} routines have been implemented in Python using serial \{FFT\} routines (either NumPy, pyFFTW or any other serial \{FFT\} module), NumPy array manipulations and with \{MPI\} communications handled by \{MPI\} for Python (mpi4py). We show how we are able to execute a 3D parallel \{FFT\} in Python for a slab mesh decomposition using 4 lines of compact Python code, for which the parallel performance on Shaheen is found to be slightly better than similar routines provided through the \{FFTW\} library. For a pencil mesh decomposition 7 lines of code is required to execute a transform.},

	abstract = {Intrathecal drug and gene vector delivery is a procedure to release a solute within the cerebrospinal fluid. This procedure is currently used in clinical practice and shows promise for treatment of several central nervous system pathologies. However, intrathecal delivery protocols and systems are not yet optimized. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of injection parameters on solute distribution within the cervical subarachnoid space using a numerical platform. We developed a numerical model based on a patient-specific three dimensional geometry of the cervical subarachnoid space with idealized dorsal and ventral nerve roots and denticulate ligament anatomy. We considered the drug as massless particles within the flow field and with similar properties as the CSF, and we analyzed the effects of anatomy, catheter position, angle and injection flow rate on solute distribution within the cerebrospinal fluid by performing a series of numerical simulations. Results were compared quantitatively in terms of drug peak concentration, spread, accumulation rate and appearance instant over 15 seconds following the injection. Results indicated that solute distribution within the cervical spine was altered by all parameters investigated within the time range analyzed following the injection. The presence of spinal cord nerve roots and denticulate ligaments increased drug spread by 60% compared to simulations without these anatomical features. Catheter position and angle were both found to alter spread rate up to 86%, and catheter flow rate altered drug peak concentration up to 78%. The presented numerical platform fills a first gap towards the realization of a tool to parametrically assess and optimize intrathecal drug and gene vector delivery protocols and systems. Further investigation is needed to analyze drug spread over a longer clinically relevant time frame.},

abstract = {Abstract The charging of a sounding rocket in subsonic and supersonic plasma flows with external magnetic field is studied with numerical particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. A weakly magnetized plasma regime is considered that corresponds to the ionospheric F2 layer, with electrons being strongly magnetized, while the magnetization of ions is weak. It is demonstrated that the magnetic field orientation influences the floating potential of the rocket and that with increasing angle between the rocket axis and the magnetic field direction the rocket potential becomes less negative. External magnetic field gives rise to asymmetric wake downstream of the rocket. The simulated wake in the potential and density may extend as far as 30 electron Debye lengths; thus, it is important to account for these plasma perturbations when analyzing in situ measurements. A qualitative agreement between simulation results and the actual measurements with a sounding rocket is also shown.},

@article{Mortensen2006,
	abstract = {The mapping closure of Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett., 63, 1989] is a transported probability density function (PDF) method that has proven very efficient for modelling of turbulent mixing in homogeneous turbulence. By utilizing a Gaussian reference field, the solution to the mapping function (in homogeneous turbulence) can be found analytically for a range of initial conditions common for turbulent combustion applications, e.g. for binary or trinary mixing. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the possibility of making this solution a presumed mapping function (PMF) for inhomogeneous flows. The PMF in turn will imply a presumed mixture fraction PDF that can be used for a wide range of models in turbulent combustion, e.g. flamelet models, the conditional moment closure (CMC) or large eddy simulations. The true novelty of the paper, though, is in the derivation of highly efficient, closed algebraic expressions for several existing models of conditional statistics, e.g. for the conditional scalar dissipation/diffusion rate or the conditional mean velocity. The closed form expressions nearly eliminates the overhead computational cost that usually is associated with nonlinear models for conditional statistics. In this respect it is argued that the PMF is particularly well suited for CMC that relies heavily on manipulations of the PDF for consistency. The accuracy of the PMF approach is shown with comparison to DNS of a single scalar mixing layer to be better than for the $\beta$-PDF. Not only in the shape of the PDF itself, but also for all conditional statistics models computed from the PDF.},

The algorithm chosen to advance the momentum and 12421 pressure in time is a fractional step approach that is memory efficient, but incurs a splitting error due 12422 to the uncoupling of the velocity and pressure. The significance of this splitting error is validated 12423 through comparison with a more accurate fully coupled solver that, due to its higher memory cost, 12424 is less suitable for large-scale turbulence applications. The performance of the solvers is validated 12425 with the one-dimensional Burgers' equation, the Orr--Sommerfeld perturbation in two dimensions 12426 and finally the three-dimensional unstable and transitional Taylor--Green vortex.},

abstract = {Summary Time integration of Fourier pseudospectral DNS is usually performed using the classical fourth-order accurate Runge-Kutta method or other second- or third-order methods, with a fixed step size. We investigate the use of higher-order Runge-Kutta pairs and automatic step size control based on local error estimation. We find that the fifth-order accurate Runge-Kutta pair of Bogacki and Shampine gives much greater accuracy at a significantly reduced computational cost. Specifically, we demonstrate speedups of 2× to 10× for the same accuracy. Numerical tests (including the Taylor-Green vortex, Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and homogeneous isotropic turbulence) confirm the reliability and efficiency of the method. We also show that adaptive time stepping provides a significant computational advantage for some problems (like the development of a Rayleigh-Taylor instability) without compromising accuracy.},

abstract = "Solving the Navier–Stokes equations when the density field contains a large and sharp discontinuity—such as a water/air free surface—is numerically challenging. Convective instabilities cause Gibbs oscillations which quickly destroy the solution. We investigate the use of slope limiters for the velocity field to overcome this problem in a way that does not compromise on the mass-conservation properties. The equations are discretised using a symmetric interior-penalty discontinuous Galerkin finite element method that is divergence-free to machine precision. A slope limiter made specifically for exactly divergence-free (solenoidal) fields is presented and used to illustrate the difficulties in obtaining convectively stable fields that are also exactly solenoidal. The lessons learned from this are applied in constructing a simpler method based on the use of an existing scalar slope limiter applied to each velocity component. We show by numerical examples how both presented slope limiting methods are vastly superior to the naive non-limited method. The methods can solve difficult two-phase problems with high density-ratios and high Reynolds numbers—typical for marine and offshore water/air simulations—in a way that conserves mass and stops unbounded energy growth caused by the Gibbs phenomenon."
