# Professor Mikael Mortensen received his PhD in mathematical modeling
# of turbulent reactive flows from [Chalmers University of Technology](http://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx), Sweden in 2005. He then worked for one year
# as a Post-Doctoral research fellow at the University of Sydney, in the world
# leading research group of Prof. Robert W. Bilger at the [School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic
# Engineering](http://web.aeromech.usyd.edu.au/index.php). While in Sydney he
# worked mainly with developing mathematical models for spray combustion, and
# turbulent mixing of flows with multiple injections. Returning to Norway,
# he worked with turbulence modelling and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for five years at the [Norwegian Defence Research Establishment](https://www.ffi.no), before
# arriving as an Associate Professor in 2012 at the [University of Oslo](http://www.uio.no), Norway. Since May 2019 he has been working as full Professor.
# 
# Prof. Mortensen is interested in CFD and the many aspects of turbulent fluid
# flows, ranging from physics, modeling, numerical methods, software implementation and applications.
# And since such topics as turbulence, CFD and scientific computing are relevant
# for a wide range of
# different research fields, his later research topics venture into fields
# such as plasma physics, biomedical flows, multiphase and numerical analysis.
# In recent years he has been working extensively with finite element (FEniCS) and spectral codes for Direct
# Numerical Simulation (DNS) of turbulence, with codes preferably written in the high-level Python language.
