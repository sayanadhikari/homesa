Welcome to my homepage!!

I work as a Postdoctoral Fellow in Space Plasma at the [Department of Physics](https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/), [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/), Norway.

My primary interests are modeling and simulation of plasma processes in experimental, and natural plasma systems. Along with development, and optimization of computer codes, I like to simulate physical systems.

Here at [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/), I am a part of the [4DSpace strategic research initiative](https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/projects/4dspace/), where we study plasma interaction with spacecraft bodies and Langmuir probes in the polar ionosphere.

Apart from research, I like writing [popular science articles](https://gmsciencein.com/user/sayanadhikari207/?profiletab=posts) and spent time in [outreaching students in rural part of India](https://foundation.gmsciencein.com/) to promote science. In spare time, I like building computers especially low-cost clusters using Raspberry Pi.

I am also passionate about nature and wildlife, which led to my interest in Nature Photography. I like to capture moments where I mostly stick with my smartphone compared to Digital Camera. I frequently try to update my [instagram profile](https://www.instagram.com/sayanadhikari207/) with such captures.

<!-- These lectures are a mini-version of a [longer
series](https://executablebooks.github.io/quantecon-example/docs/index.html)
of lectures, also built using Jupyter Book 2.0.  That series contains more
features and applications but also requires more libraries and takes longer to
run.  

Both lecture series are taken from a [more complete set of
lectures](https://python.quantecon.org) on open source computing hosted by
[QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org). -->
